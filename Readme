The main.py contains the basic demonstration of how to use RSA to share AES key, and then use AES to encrypt/decrypt data.

Alice.py contains the user interface used by those who need to initialize a data transfer by sending out the RSA public key.

Bob.py contains the user interface used by those who want to participate in a data transfer by receiving the RSA public key.

Screenshots show how the code runs, and also my health conditions causing the user interface to be submitted later.
